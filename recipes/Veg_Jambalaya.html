    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>

    <p>One Spring weekend around Mardi Gras, we found ourselves missing New Orleans and feeling some fomo from all of the Insta posts on our feed from friends who still live there. I had never tried, or even seen a veg jambalaya, but thought it was possible. It turned out to be even simpler than I thought it would be. If you have a favorite source of veg "shrimp" or "crawfish" you should definitely add it! That's not something we have access to in Columbus, OH (as far as we know).</p>

    <h4>Have a laugh at these people trying to slice okra, and then maybe learn something about okra from the chef at the end.</h4>
